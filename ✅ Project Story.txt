SQL Workbench: Filtered reviews, extracted year and month from dates, and categorised verified purchases for granular insights

Python: Processed review texts and implemented keyword-based sentiment tagging to classify customer sentiment

Power BI: Designed and developed an interactive dashboard to visualise key trends and insights

Excel: Performed additional data cleaning and prepared data exports for Power BI

Key SQL Operations:

Extracted reviews with 1-star ratings only, ensuring focused analysis on dissatisfied customers

Derived year and month from review dates to identify temporal trends

Categorised verified purchase status to differentiate genuine buyers from others

Python Tasks:

Applied keyword-based sentiment labelling on review texts, tagging reviews as ‘Negative’ or ‘Neutral’ using relevant keywords like “bad”, “fake”, and “broken”

Enhanced accuracy of sentiment classification to reflect real customer emotions

Key Insights:

All reviews analysed had 1-star ratings, indicating complete customer dissatisfaction

Negative sentiment clearly dominated, highlighting issues with product sizing, quality, and counterfeit goods

Even verified purchasers reported negative experiences, suggesting serious trust and quality concerns

Business Value:
